First, we need to modify the function in problem into 
The following pictures show train and test error without regularization

For a lambda value hovering around 700, a remarkable equilibrium emerges in the realm of train and test errors. These errors converge to a level of nearly 0.5, finding a point of relative stability.

As lambda's magnitude grows, a distinct pattern takes shape: the test error steadily diminishes, eventually reaching a state of steadiness after a certain duration. Simultaneously, the train error embarks on an opposing journey, ascending gradually until it too settles into a stable state, albeit within defined boundaries.
